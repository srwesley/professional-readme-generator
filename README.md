# Professional README Generator
Assignment application for Week 9 - Node.js for bootcamp

## Task
Creating an application that is run through the terminal using node.js as well as the NPM Inquirer, version 8.2.4, to complete a README page.

This README page gives various details regarding information loaded on to it that is asked through the terminal, such as the name of the project, what it's used for, selecting licenses, and the contact info - such as GitHub username, name, and email - of the person entering the information.
